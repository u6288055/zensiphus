    <p id="whatisecg-para"> 
      An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a simple test that can be used to check your heart's rhythm and electrical activity.
      <br>Sensors attached to the skin are used to detect the electrical signals produced by your heart each time it beats.
      <br>These signals are recorded by a machine and are looked at by a doctor to see if they're unusual.
      <br>An ECG may be requested by a heart specialist (cardiologist) or any doctor who thinks you might have a problem with your heart, including your GP.
      <br>The test can be carried out by a specially trained healthcare professional at a hospital, a clinic or at your GP surgery.
      <br>Despite having a similar name, an ECG isn't the same as an echocardiogram, which is a scan of the heart.

  <div class="what-info-box">
    <p id="whatinfo-para">
      An ECG recording machine will usually show your heart rhythm and electrical activity as a graph displayed electronically or printed on paper.
      <br>For an ambulatory ECG, the ECG machine will store the information about your heart electronically, which can be accessed by a doctor when the test is complete.
      <br>You may not be able to get the results of your ECG immediately. The recordings may need to be looked at by a specialist doctor to see if there are signs of 
      a possible problem. Other tests may also be needed before it's possible to tell you whether there's a problem.
      <br>You may need to visit the hospital, clinic or your GP a few days later to discuss your results with a doctor.

    <h1 id="howhelp">How it <br>will help us <br>predict <br>depression</h1>
    <p id="howhelp-para">
      Depression has been linked to changes in the autonomic nervous system, which controls the function of the heart and other internal organs. These changes 
      can lead to altered heart rate variability (HRV), which is a measure of the variation in time between successive heartbeats.

      Research has shown that individuals with depression tend to have reduced HRV, which may be related to the altered functioning of the autonomic nervous system. 
      By measuring HRV using ECG, researchers may be able to identify individuals who are at risk of developing depression or who may already be experiencing depressive symptoms.
